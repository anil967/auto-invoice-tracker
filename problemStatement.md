# Automated Invoice Tracking and Processing System

**Product Requirements Document (PRD) - v1.0**  
**February 2026**

## 1. Executive Summary

Digital Enterprise processes 2,500+ invoices annually with an average cycle time of 65 days. This solution automates invoice management using AI/ML and IDP to reduce processing time to <15 days, improve accuracy, and provide end-to-end visibility through SAP and Ringi Portal integration.

## 2. Problem & Solution

### Current Challenges
- 65-day average processing time
- No centralized tracking platform
